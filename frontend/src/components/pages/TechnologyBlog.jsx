          Technology is evolving at an unprecedented pace, transforming industries, economies, and even societies. The technologies of tomorrow promise to reshape the way we live, work, and interact with the world. In this blog, we'll explore three major innovations that are driving the future of technology.
        </p>

        {/* Section 1: Artificial Intelligence */}
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept—it's here, and it's changing everything. From self-driving cars to personalized healthcare, AI is automating tasks, improving efficiency, and even making decisions that were once the domain of humans.
        </p>

         

        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          The rapid advancement of machine learning, neural networks, and data analytics is enabling AI to perform tasks that require learning, adaptation, and decision-making. As AI continues to evolve, its impact on industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics will only grow.
        </p>

        {/* Section 2: Robotics */}
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Robotics</h2>
        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Robotics is another field that is making leaps and bounds. Robots are being used in manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, and even exploration. With the ability to automate physical tasks, robots are increasing productivity and reducing human labor in many sectors.
        </p>

        
        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Advances in robotics are also enabling machines to perform tasks that were once thought to be impossible for machines—such as performing complex surgeries or exploring distant planets. The future of robotics looks incredibly bright, with innovations such as soft robotics and autonomous robots on the horizon.
        </p>

        {/* Section 3: Blockchain Technology */}
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Blockchain Technology</h2>
        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Blockchain technology, the backbone of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, is being hailed as a revolutionary way to securely and transparently record transactions. Beyond finance, blockchain has the potential to disrupt industries such as supply chain management, voting systems, and even identity verification.
        </p>

        

        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Blockchain works by creating a distributed ledger that is shared among all participants, ensuring that every transaction is transparent and immutable. This decentralized approach has the potential to increase trust, security, and efficiency in various sectors.
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          From AI and robotics to blockchain and beyond, the future of technology is full of promise and potential. As these technologies continue to evolve, they will undoubtedly shape the world in ways we can't yet imagine.
