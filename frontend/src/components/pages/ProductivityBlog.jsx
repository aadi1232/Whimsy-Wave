          Productivity is not about working harder; it’s about working smarter. In a world full of distractions, staying focused and maximizing your efficiency can make a significant difference in your work and personal life. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your time.
        </p>

        {/* Section 1: Prioritization */}
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">1. Prioritize Your Tasks</h2>
        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Start your day by identifying your most important tasks. Use the Eisenhower Matrix to distinguish between what is urgent and what is important. Tackle the most important and impactful tasks first, rather than getting caught up in minor tasks that consume your energy but don’t move the needle.
        </p>

        {/* Section 2: Time Blocking */}
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">2. Use Time Blocking</h2>
        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Time blocking is a method where you dedicate specific blocks of time to particular tasks. By scheduling your tasks and sticking to the time blocks, you can minimize distractions and focus on one thing at a time. For example, allocate a 2-hour block for deep work and another block for meetings and emails.
        </p>

        {/* Section 3: Minimize Distractions */}
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">3. Minimize Distractions</h2>
        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Whether it’s your phone, social media, or office noise, distractions are everywhere. Turn off non-essential notifications, use website blockers to limit access to distracting websites, and consider working in a quiet environment. If you're working from home, set clear boundaries with family members to minimize interruptions.
        </p>

        {/* Section 4: Take Breaks */}
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">4. Take Regular Breaks</h2>
        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Working for long hours without breaks can lead to burnout and decreased productivity. Follow the Pomodoro technique, where you work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. After four cycles, take a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes. This approach helps you stay focused while giving your mind the rest it needs.
        </p>

        {/* Section 5: Review and Reflect */}
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">5. Review and Reflect</h2>
        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          At the end of each day or week, take some time to review what you have accomplished and what could be improved. Regular reflection will help you understand your productivity patterns, allowing you to adjust and improve over time.
