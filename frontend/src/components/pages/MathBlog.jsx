        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">The Beauty of Algebra</h2>
        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Algebra is the language of mathematics. It allows us to represent unknowns with variables and create equations that model real-world situations. By solving these equations, we gain insights into the relationships between different elements.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-xl mb-6">
          <li><strong>Linear Equations</strong>: These equations represent straight lines and are the simplest form of algebraic expression.</li>
          <li><strong>Quadratic Equations</strong>: These are polynomial equations of degree 2, forming parabolas when graphed.</li>
          <li><strong>Systems of Equations</strong>: A set of equations with multiple variables, which are solved together to find common solutions.</li>
        </ul>

        

        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Algebra is not just for academicsâ€”its principles are applied in everything from economics to architecture, helping us to understand and solve complex problems.

        {/* Section 2: Calculus */}
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Exploring the Depth of Calculus</h2>
        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Calculus, the study of change, has revolutionized our understanding of the universe. It allows us to model motion, growth, decay, and much more. Here are two fundamental concepts of calculus:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-xl mb-6">
          <li><strong>Differentiation</strong>: The process of finding the rate of change (or slope) of a function at any point.</li>
          <li><strong>Integration</strong>: The reverse process of differentiation, used to calculate areas under curves and accumulated quantities.</li>
        </ul>

        

        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          From determining the optimal shape of a bridge to predicting the path of a spacecraft, calculus is fundamental to engineering, economics, physics, and more.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Mathematics in the Real World</h2>
        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Mathematics is not confined to the classroom. Its principles are applied in fields as diverse as cryptography, weather forecasting, and machine learning. By understanding mathematical models, we can solve practical problems, make better decisions, and even explore new frontiers in science and technology.

        <p className="text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Whether it's predicting market trends, optimizing transportation routes, or unlocking the secrets of the universe, mathematics is the key to understanding the world around us.
